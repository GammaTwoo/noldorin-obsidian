### What are they doing here?

Kian has been carrying out Annwn's task of defending the island ever since he died. They have set up magical/illusory traps around the island so that a projection of them will appear and hold off intruders long enough for them to arrive.
### Which PC will trigger them in some way?

Kian might feel repulsed at Atticus's glaive, express interest in Kylen's quiver, and would have a deep respect for Orin's values.
### How did they get where they are today?

Kian was first the beloved pet fox of Annwn, who decided to immortalize them when he became powerful enough. Kian gained their magic powers through training with Annwn and by the very nature of their existence. Kian's personality comes from the fact that the only other personality on this island is an eccentric wizard.
