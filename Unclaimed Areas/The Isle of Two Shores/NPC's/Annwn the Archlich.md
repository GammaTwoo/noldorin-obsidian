### What are they doing here?

At the request of Elkenmage, he is here to watch over Malice's/Malachi's temple and report any suspicious activity. In their spare time, they have been working on a way to ascend to Lichdom without the use of souls to power a phylactery.



### Who are they drawn towards?

He is drawn towards the innate magic in Atticus that he somehow hasn't found out about yet.

### How did they get where they are today?

They were one of the 5 wizards of the scourge, helping Elkenmage seal seal Malice and Leviathan away in the Calming Gate until they can be defeated for good.
### Will they give the party anything?

Some information on the temple, but only ever referring to it as Malachi's temple.
 - The temple was created by Malachi
 - He hasn't been back in nearly a thousand years
 - Malachi controls powerful magic not of this world
 - The temple is cursed, and even after a thousand years no one has been able to loot it, or its artifacts.
	 -  One of the artifacts is the Sundering Blade, used to sever any tie between any two things. Limited only by imagination
 - Malachi built the temple atop the remains of an old cultist hideout, was forced to move it to the sea and build the island around it.

"You can go down if you wish, it will take a long time and its dark and wet the whole way down. Easiest way down is to jump towards the blue light in the sea below the cliffs outside."

When pressed about why she built the trapdoor, blood will rush to her cheeks and she'll avoid the party's gaze
"I'm afraid of heights."
