**How They're Getting There**
An Orin specific story point, can happen whenever so long as Orin engages in the story hook.

Varjo will be staring at the sky, at the edge of the cliff. Should Orin approach, he will say, "Beautiful isn't it? The sky is especially clear tonight"

A cool, dry breeze drifts over the mountain, bringing smells of the forest down below, and the sea beyond it.

After Orin engages

"Would you like to see what I see?" He looks over slowly, eyes reflecting the night sky above.

Yes:
"Good"
As you hold his gaze, the reflections in his eyes begin to grow more vibrant and clear, swirling with color. Looking up, what was once a simple, starry sky is now painted with the likeness of a thousand nebula, all of which you've never even fathomed. Had it not been right in front of you, you would call it a fever dream, and yet there it is in all of its brilliance. Nearly blinding, the light that now enters your eyes, and yet its hard to look away.
"Do you understand why I gaze tonight?"

No:
"Very well. I'll be here."
