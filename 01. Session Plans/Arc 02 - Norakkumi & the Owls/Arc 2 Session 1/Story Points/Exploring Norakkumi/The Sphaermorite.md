The large meteor at Norakkumi's center. It landed here millenia ago, and the ores it exposed provided the basis for the city of Norakkumi to thrive. The meteor itself is made of pure crystal, seemingly unbreakable. Around the meteor is a small platform, where certain culturally significant ceremonies and performance would be held. An Old King decreed that none may mine towards the center of the city, under the meteor. Those who try are afflicted with a curse, unbreakable and horrible.
