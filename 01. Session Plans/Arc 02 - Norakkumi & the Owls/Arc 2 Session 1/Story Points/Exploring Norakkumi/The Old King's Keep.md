The keep of the last king of Norakkumi just outside Norakkumi's walls. Two guards stand outside it, afflicted with a similar immortality that Niamh is. They never move, never eat, never sleep, never blink, never breath. The keep itself is a big block of stone on a small hill, looking over the outer regions of Norakkumi. Its presence is kind of menacing, and it seems to call to all that see it "keep out. there is nothing here."
