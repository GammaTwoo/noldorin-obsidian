Kylen is in what we can assume is Berk's home, or at least something that Berk can tell people is his home (whos to say really). Berk has just told Kylen that he thinks hes found Kylens father, and that hes a bad person.

"That was a bit of a hyperbole, but I did find a name."

He slaps a thin book (Similar to my padfolio) on Kylens lap

"Go ahead, look"

Inside is a list of hundreds of deposits. All under different names, for different amounts from large to small. Investigation - Every 2 higher on the roll is 5 unique names gleened from rifling through the pages.

If pressed - 

"Now youve seen that, look at this"

Its a list of transfers, all under names from the other bank log. All to S. Xistrith, from the names in the previous notebook each has a length of time written next to it, between 3 days and a year

"Now I already did you the favor of parsing both of those logs. Those markings are the length of time between the deposit into the original account and the transfer to Mr Xistrith."

DC 10 Passive insight - Berk is noticably more intelligent than he was when you last saw him
DC 15 Perception - a small flash of silver on his head, obscured by his hair, a headband
