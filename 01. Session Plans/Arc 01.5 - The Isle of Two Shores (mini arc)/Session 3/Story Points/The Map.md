At first glance the map seems unimportant. A simple map of Noldorin. But there's a power in it, deep and intense. Much larger than the map itself. The power doesn't feel evil, nor does it feel particularly good. It seems to just be, at the whim of its user.

**How They'll Get There**
The map is in Malachi's Temple, just after one of the traps.

**Rewards**
The map shows the location of whatever the user wants. Can only be read through Sphaermorite.

**NPC's Involved**
None, yet.
