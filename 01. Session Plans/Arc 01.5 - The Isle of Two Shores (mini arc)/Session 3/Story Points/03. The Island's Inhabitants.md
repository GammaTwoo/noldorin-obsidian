The discovery of a new species (*sort of*) is always an exciting prospect.

**How they're going to get there**
Before they leave, one is going to approach their long rest camp at a time of rest, very cautiously.

"Just at the edge of the firelight, a faint glint can be seen. They eyes of a small creature. As you look over at them, they shy away, taking careful steps backwards."

"It steps fully into the firelight, its wings slowly closing from their ready-to-fly position. The creature is not one you've ever seen before. The wings of a hawk seem to replace the arms of this rabbit-like creature. It wobbles slight from side to side as it walks forward, very obviously more accustomed to jumping and flying than walking."

This specific Crested Cliffbounder has a case of wanderlust. It wants to know all about the world outside the island, and is curious about the strange travelers that now stand before it.

**Rewards**

The Cliffbounder, perhaps Annwn will make a comment on it.
