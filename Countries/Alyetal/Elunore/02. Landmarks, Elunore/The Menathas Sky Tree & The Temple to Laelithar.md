A tree of gargantuan proportions growing on a floating island above the Whispering Shrublands. The island is tethered to the ground by the great vines and roots coming from the tree. The tree itself is home to the only temple in the world to Laelithar, the Life Breather. Only those that have seen Laelithar can see the temple, and nowadays those that have seen Laelithar are precious few.
