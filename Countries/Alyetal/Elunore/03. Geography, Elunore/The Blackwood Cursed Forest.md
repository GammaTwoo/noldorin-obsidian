Deep within [[The Salisraine Woodland]], the blackwood cursed forest is the site of an ancient battleground, and the land still heals from the scars of the power that tore through it. The weight of this battle long since fought weighs on the shoulders of those who enter, though those numbers are few and far between. Green flames burn endlessly, but are cool to the touch. The energy and destructive will of the caster that made them has long since left.
