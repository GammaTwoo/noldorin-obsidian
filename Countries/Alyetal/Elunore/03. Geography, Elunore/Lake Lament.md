Lake Lament is located to the southeast of the Whispering Shrublands, nestled right up against the Salisraine Woodland. Lake Lament is the sort of nucleation point for the mollusk responsible for Ila'yerian Blue. It gets its name because consuming water from this lake was a death sentence shortly after the Ila'yerian Mollusk was introduced, as it overran the lake and produced enough Ila'yerian blue in the water to make it toxic.
