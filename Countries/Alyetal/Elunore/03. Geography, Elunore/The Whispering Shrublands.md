The Whispering Shrublands are an inherintly magical place. The leaves of bushes and trees here float around the branches of their trees, seemingly getting their life from nothing. And yet, they live. The floating leaves gently brush against each other throughout the day, by virtue of their soft orbiting of their parent plant. This leads to a gentle rustling throughout the shrublands, and is the reason it is named the Whispering Shrublands.
