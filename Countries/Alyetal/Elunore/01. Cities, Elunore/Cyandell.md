Cyandell lies on the east bank of [[The Roulan River]], halfway between [[Lake Lament]] and [[Lake Pengrada]] Major. Cyandell is most known for producing various blue dyes from the wildlife native to the Roulan. Specifically a kind of mollusk that produces Ila'yerian Blue in its shell and flesh. Ila'yerian Blue is very toxic, so it is Cyandell's job to keep the population of the mollusks under control, lest the water from the Roulan poison lake Pengrada.
