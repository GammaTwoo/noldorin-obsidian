The Blackvine ruins are the ruins of the old city of Belanore, the home of the original Stonewoods Elves. The stonewood elves were forced to flee after an invasion by a peoples from far away (the Far Peoples), who sailed in on great ships and razed towns all along the coast, then left without a trace. They came with swords and magic that brought death, leaving bodies that sprouted black, vein-like vines from the bodies of those that succumbed to this horrible Death Curse (hence the name of the ruins). The remaining stonewood elves were forced to flee, hiding in what is now Dread Cavern, and eventually making their way down to the Underdark and founding the first drow city of Valynore.
