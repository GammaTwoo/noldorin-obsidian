The blood tree is a morbid joke of the being known as Malachi. The tree is black, twisted, and dark in an otherwise normal forest. The leaves are thorny and contain a poison that causes immense pain if the finger is pricked. They are constantly covered in thick, deep red blood that is verifiably, guaranteeably human blood, but no magic can determine whose blood it is. Those who touch the blood have a feeling, deep down, that the blood is that of someone they love.
