The Lodbrith Field is an area of plains that divide Sweden's forests which contains an vast expanse of floating rocks, stones, and boulders ranging in size from pebble to house. The rocks arent locked in the air, and can be quite easily pushed around. Stones that are moved too far away from the fields begin to lose their floating properties, and fall to the ground until brought back, but oddly enough, outside stones dont float when brought to the fields. Those that spend too long in the fields begin to feel an impending sense of doom.
