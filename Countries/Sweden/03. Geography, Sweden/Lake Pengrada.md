Lake Pengrada is a system of two lakes, really. The larger of them is aptly named Lake Pengrada Major, and the smaller, minor. The two are connected by a waterfall that flows upwards, to the confusion of scholars worldwide. This waterfall powers the Cities of Shaeras. Lake Pengrada is fed by the Ilian, out of Lake Lament, and itself feeds [[The River of Radiance Indigo]], [[The River Requiem]], and [[The Malarmore Channel]].
